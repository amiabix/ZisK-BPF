# ZisK-BPF: Solana Zero-Knowledge Proof Prover

A working Solana ZK prover that generates cryptographic proofs of BPF program execution using ZisK.

## Features

- **Real BPF Execution**: Executes Solana BPF programs with constraint generation
- **ZisK Integration**: Compiles to RISC-V and generates ZK proofs
- **Opcode Support**: 7+ BPF opcodes with ZK constraint generation
- **End-to-End Proofs**: Complete pipeline from BPF execution to ZK proof

## Architecture

```
BPF Program → main.rs → real_bpf_loader.rs → opcode_implementations.rs → ZisK → ZK Proof
```

## Current Status

- ✅ **Working ZK proof generation** for basic BPF instruction execution
- ✅ **ZisK integration** with RISC-V compilation  
- ✅ **Constraint generation** for 7 basic BPF opcodes
- ✅ **Proof-of-concept** Solana ZK prover architecture

## Usage

```bash
# Build with ZisK
cargo-zisk build --release

# Execute and generate proof
cargo-zisk prove --elf target/riscv64ima-zisk-zkvm-elf/release/zisk_solana_prover --output-dir ./proof_output --emulator
```

## What We're Proving

The ZK proof demonstrates:
- BPF program execution correctness
- Register state changes
- Program counter advancement
- Basic constraint satisfaction

## Next Steps

- Expand to 20+ most common BPF opcodes
- Integrate real Solana RBPF crate
- Add memory management and syscalls
- Production-ready features
